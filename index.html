            <p>
              Users should not be systemically disadvantaged by the language they use for interacting with LLMs; i.e.
              users across languages should get responses of similar quality irrespective of language used. In this
              work, we create a set of real-world open-ended questions based on our analysis of the WildChat dataset and
              use it to evaluate whether responses vary by language, specifically, whether answer quality depends on the
              language used to query the model. We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such
              that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using
              LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we
              evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages. Our
              evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently provide lower quality answers to open-ended questions in low
              resource languages. We find that language significantly impacts the cultural context used by the model.
              This difference in context impacts the quality of the downstream answer.

              <h3>Evaluation Setup</h3>
              <p>
                For each question and language pair, we generate 10 responses per model with temperature set to 1.
                We evaluate all the responses using LLM as a Judge with the temperature set to 0.
                Our evaluation covered the following models: Qwen3-14B, Cohere-Aya-32B, Cohere-Aya-8B, Magistral and
                Sarvam-m.
              </p>
              <h3>LLM-as-a-Judge Setup</h3>
              <p>
                To ensure the quality of evaluation using LLM-as-a-Judge, we performed several ablations to choose the
                best
                configuration. We took a subset of 10 queries from the 20 queries we created and a subset of languages:
                English, Hindi, Chinese and Hebrew. For each query and language pair, we prompted Cohere-Aya-32B to
                generate 5 responses, corresponding to scores from 1 to 5 by providing it the rubrics to be used for
                evaluation. We use these responses for evaluating our Judge and the score corresponding the response as
                the ground truth score.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use Cohere Command-A model and test 6 configurations of LLM-as-a-Judge:

              <p>
                We note that we only provide randomly chosen reference responses to the model without any evaluation,
                making our methodology different from few-shot prompting and eliminating the need for human evaluated
                responses for reference. Providing reference examples to the model leads to higher alignment with ground
                truth scores as evaluated using Pearson correlation and Cohen's Kappa score. Using original query and
                response along with 8 randomly chosen examples lead to the highest alignment, hence we choose this
                configuration for our evaluations.

              We created a set of 20 advice-seeking questions covering a wide variety of topics like Healthcare,
              Business, and Education for evaluating performance on open-ended tasks. These questions were created based
              on our analysis of the <a href="https://wildchat.allen.ai/" target="_blank">WildChat Dataset</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              As part of our analysis, we began with initial filtering and cleaning. From the WildChat dataset, we
              retained only queries in English and removed queries related to programming bugs or error fixes, as they
              are niche and skew the dataset. We kept queries with lengths ranging from 40 to 400 characters and
              excluded duplicate or highly similar queries with a threshold of 60 using the <a
                href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy" target="_blank">fuzzywuzzy</a> library.
            </p>
            <p>
              We converted the queries to embeddings using the Qwen3-0.6b embedding model and clustered them using
              the HDBSCAN algorithm, followed by manual analysis to create the evaluation queries. The questions were
              structured in a culture-independent manner. We then translated the queries to Chinese, Hindi, Brazilian
              Portuguese, Swahili, and Hebrew using the Gemini-2.5-Flash model.

                      <li>Over the past few years, I've noticed a significant decline in my memory. This concerns me,
                        and I worry about the possibility of developing conditions like madness or Alzheimer's in the
                        future. I'm seeking advice on how to improve my overall well-being, specifically my physical,
                        brain, and psychological health.</li>
                      <li>Make me a meal plan of a week's worth of meals. I need 3 meals a day. I must hit a protein
                        goal of 120 grams of protein everyday, and my calories for each day is 3000 calories. Be as
                        detailed as possible and include the calorie count and protein count for each meal. I don't eat
                        meat. Create a grocery list as well.</li>
                      <li>Give me a workout routine for calisthenics with the split push pull legs upper lower workout
                        for beginner and with just dumbbells 5-10 kg, pull-up bar, resistance band, bodyweight,
                        gymnastic rings, and best calories intake for 76kg and 173cm tall.</li>
                      <li>Create a 30 minute work out routine for beginners that I can do at home.</li>
